# HostingServer_CollectingDataFromWireShark_Visualisation
From serv.py we are connecting with server. We are collecting data with the help of wireshark. Visualiation of the data is done with python.


## Steps to follow in order to run this project:

1. Connect your PC with the local hotspot (i.e. Mobile phone).
2. Open the terminal and type ipconfig (to check the IP address) and hit enter.
3. Copy the IP address from the terminal in the serv.py file.
4. Make sure index.html page is in the same directory.
5. Run the serv.py and type same IP in browser of the phone along with port address. (192.168.43.23:8081)
6. This is the way to establish the connection and index.html will open in your phone.
7. Go to wireshark software and collect data in csv format. cn.py will plot that data.
